    World-class reputation

As part of the University of London for 120 years, we have a rich academic heritage, but we’re constantly questioning, challenging and building on what we know.

Goldsmiths is recognised as a leading university for research with nearly four-fifths of research by academics considered “world leading” or “internationally excellent”, according to the last Research Excellence Framework (2021).

Our mix of students, who come to study with us from around 130 countries, has helped make us the 69th 'most international' university in the world (QS World University Rankings 2022).

Many of our subjects have been rated as world-leading, based on the QS World University Rankings by Subject 2023.
Innovative and exciting

Expect to be challenged. At Goldsmiths, you’ll be inspired to develop fresh ideas and new approaches to your discipline through the teaching of renowned academics and your own research.

Our postgraduate programmes champion perspectives that push the boundaries, provoke thought and stretch the imagination. That’s why so many of our former students are leading the way in reshaping the sociocultural landscape on a global scale.
Inspiring location

London is the best city in the world in which to be a student (QS Best Student Cities 2024). We are based in New Cross, in South-East London. The area has a thriving music and arts scene, buzzing cafes, and a genuinely diverse and eclectic population. At just 10 minutes from central London by train, it is the perfect base from which to explore the intellectual, cultural and career opportunities that the city has to offer. 

Our Graduate School community, exciting events programme and student life mean that whatever your interests, you're bound to find your place in our welcoming academic community.
Employability

Our dedicated careers service, placement opportunities and contemporary courses mean you’ll graduate with the skills and knowledge to succeed in your future career.

Employers rank us as one of the country’s best universities to recruit from, according to the Times Higher Education magazine.
